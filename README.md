#Thanks to luke, andystrobel  for the mail module. 

This module is the mail module taken from the website above and then modified to give admin the ability to control who has mail privileges based on which group the user is in.

Above you can see that the user doesn't have mail privilages. So the mail icon doesn't show up on their screen. 

Screenshot three.

Above you can see that once they are moved into a group with mail privilages they then have access to the mail icon again. 

Check out the Members Certified module to only allow mail privilages to the users that have been certified as real people.
